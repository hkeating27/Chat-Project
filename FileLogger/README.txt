**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
The File Logging portion of this assignment was by far the easiest. It didn't really take much more than
what we learned in the lab and what was given in the assignment description. We didn't really have any problems
with it, so there aren't really many comments.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
No references used besides my brain, lectures, and Piazza.

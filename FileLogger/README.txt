**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
I don't really have any comments on this assignment. It was enjoyable and allowed me to
think even more in a SE mindset.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
No references used besides my brain, lectures, and Piazza. I also used the Formula shell that
was given in the assignment details.

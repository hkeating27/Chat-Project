This application can be run as either the client or server. The easiest way to do so is via Visual Studio; at the top run bar you can choose between ChatClient or ChatServer,
running either as a Windows Machine. You must run ChatServer before ChatClient can connect to it. The default, localhost, will connect you to a server running on the same IP.

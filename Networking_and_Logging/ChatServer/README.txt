**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
I have mostly the same comments as I did in the ChatClient README, with the exception that once the ChatClient
GUI got working, the ChatServer GUI was working pretty soon after.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.

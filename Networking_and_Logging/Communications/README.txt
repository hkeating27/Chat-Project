**Comments to Evaluators:**
We are aware that fragments of messages sometimes add on quasi-randomly, and that this is due to the buffer not fully clearing. We halved the amount of extra
messages using Array.Clear(), but some still remain.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
The Networking class was probably the most agitating part of this assignment since everything in it was new.
Probably around 90-95% of the bugs in this project came from the Networking class, so we spent
a lot of time in this class. Having never used Tcp in any project before this didn't make it any easier (seeing
something in lecture is much different than actually having to do a whole project centered around it). We did enjoy
the opportunity to do something I've never done before (client-server communications).


**Consulted Peers:**
We didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. We did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if We had a question and asked a question ourself.

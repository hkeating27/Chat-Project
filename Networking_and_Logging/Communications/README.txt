**Comments to Evaluators:**
My work stands on its own.


**Assignment Specific Topics:**
The Networking class was probably the most agitating part of this assignment since everything in it was new.
Probably around 90-95% of the bugs in this project came from the Networking class, so me and my partner spent
a lot of time in this class. Having never used Tcp in any project before this didn't make it any easier (seeing
something in lecture is much different than actually having to do a whole project centered around it). I did enjoy
the opportunity to do something I've never done before (client-server communications), but my god did I hate this.


**Consulted Peers:**
I didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. I did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.

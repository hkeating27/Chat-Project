**Comments to Evaluators:**
None of the Command functions work. 

**Assignment Specific Topics:**
This was by far the most difficult and least rewarding assignment. Virtually every step of the assignment brought
a whole new challenge and several new bugs. Every bug took so long to debug that by the time the simplest thing
got working it didn't even feel rewarding to finally get something working, it was just agitating that it took 
so long.


**Consulted Peers:**
We didn't specifically ask anyone for help on this project. We did, however, look on Piazza and ask
if I had a question and asked a question myself.


**References:**
No references used besides our brains, lectures and slides, official documentation, and Piazza.
